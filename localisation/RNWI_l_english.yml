It used to be that the Imperial Cartographers would deliver us the records of their expeditions on their way back to the mainland, and what little we know of this new world we know from those maps. We must take it upon ourselves to continue their work, sailing further into the horizon than ever before. Perhaps, with luck, we will find our way home again."

Other nations shall know that any harm done to our merchants is a crime against our majesty, and that our retribution shall be swift. The merchant that bears the republican seal shall walk in safety in foreign lands and waters, and shall seek riskier and more lucrative deals as a result."
